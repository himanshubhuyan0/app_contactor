It's still\navailable at its original location, but is deprecated and will\neventually be removed.\n\n### iOS Quirks\n\n- <iOS7 can't detect the type of cellular network connection.\n    - `navigator.connection.type` is set to `Connection.CELL` for all cellular data.\n\n### Windows Phone Quirks\n\n- When running in the emulator, always detects `navigator.connection.type` as `Connection.UNKNOWN`.\n\n- Windows Phone can't detect the type of cellular network connection.\n    - `navigator.connection.type` is set to `Connection.CELL` for all cellular data.\n\n### Windows Quirks\n\n- When running in the Phone 8.1 emulator, always detects `navigator.connection.type` as `Connection.ETHERNET`.\n\n### Tizen Quirks\n\n- Tizen can only detect a WiFi or cellular connection.\n    - `navigator.connection.type` is set to `Connection.CELL_2G` for all cellular data.\n\n### Firefox OS Quirks\n\n- Firefox OS can't detect the type of cellular network connection.\n    - `navigator.connection.type` is set to `Connection.CELL` for all cellular data.\n\n### Browser Quirks\n\n- Browser can't detect the type of network connection.\n`navigator.connection.type` is always set to `Connection.UNKNOWN` when online.\n\n# Network-related Events\n\n## offline\n\nThe event fires when an application goes offline, and the device is\nnot connected to the Internet.\n\n    document.addEventListener(\"offline\", yourCallbackFunction, false);\n\n### Details\n\nThe `offline` event fires when a previously connected device loses a\nnetwork connection so that an application can no longer access the\nInternet.  It relies on the same information as the Connection API,\nand fires when the value of `connection.type` becomes `NONE`.\n\nApplications typically should use `document.addEventListener` to\nattach an event listener once the `deviceready` event fires.\n\n### Quick Example\n\n    document.addEventListener(\"offline\", onOffline, false);\n\n    function onOffline() {\n        // Handle the offline event\n    }\n\n\n### iOS Quirks\n\nDuring initial startup, the first offline event (if applicable) takes at least a second to fire.\n\n### Windows Phone 7 Quirks\n\nWhen running in the Emulator, the `connection.status` is always unknown, so this event does _not_ fire.\n\n### Windows Phone 8 Quirks\n\nThe Emulator reports the connection type as `Cellular`, which does not change, so the event does _not_ fire.\n\n## online\n\nThis event fires when an application goes online, and the device\nbecomes connected to the Internet.\n\n    document.addEventListener(\"online\", yourCallbackFunction, false);\n\n### Details\n\nThe `online` event fires when a previously unconnected device receives\na network connection to allow an application access to the Internet.\nIt relies on the same information as the Connection API,\nand fires when the `connection.type` changes from `NONE` to any other\nvalue.\n\nApplications typically should use `document.addEventListener` to\nattach an event listener once the `deviceready` event fires.\n\n### Quick Example\n\n    document.addEventListener(\"online\", onOnline, false);\n\n    function onOnline() {\n        // Handle the online event\n    }\n\n\n### iOS Quirks\n\nDuring initial startup, the first `online` event (if applicable) takes\nat least a second to fire, prior to which `connection.type` is\n`UNKNOWN`.\n\n### Windows Phone 7 Quirks\n\nWhen running in the Emulator, the `connection.status` is always unknown, so this event does _not_ fire.\n\n### Windows Phone 8 Quirks\n\nThe Emulator reports the connection type as `Cellular`, which does not change, so events does _not_ fire.\n\n[Apache Cordova issue tracker]: https://issues.apache.org/jira/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20CB%20AND%20status%20in%20%28Open%2C%20%22In%20Progress%22%2C%20Reopened%29%20AND%20resolution%20%3D%20Unresolved%20AND%20component%20%3D%20%22Plugin%20Network%20Information%22%20ORDER%20BY%20priority%20DESC%2C%20summary%20ASC%2C%20updatedDate%20DESC\n",
